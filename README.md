OneDegreeNorth-FRC-2014
=======================

This repository contains an Netbeans-compatible project file using the 2014 Java WPILib API for the 2014 FIRST Robotics Competition, Aerial Assist.

This is the Open Sourced software repository for the One Degree North FRC team (#4817) from Singapore American School, the first and only team from Singapore.

The Robot, Orchid IV, has a CIM launcher geared to launch the game balls. Our main competitive edge is to use the vision processing system to automate launches.
